                    <h3>Myth: Kids with mental illness grow up to be violent adults.</h3>
                    <p>Fact: Most people with mental health issues are nonviolent. In fact, research consistently shows that only 3-5% of violent acts can be linked to severe mental illness. People with mental health conditions are no more likely to be violent than the average person.</p>

                <div class="myth-card">
                    <h3>Myth: Mental illness is a sign of personal weakness.</h3>
                    <p>Fact: Mental illness is a legitimate medical condition, just like any physical illness. This attitude prevents people from seeking treatment early on, ultimately worsening conditions. This fails to account the external factors that contribute to mental illness, such as genetics, early childhood experiences, and trauma.</p>

                <div class="myth-card">
                    <h3>Myth: Treatment is ineffective for kids with mental illness.</h3>
                    <p>Fact: Mental illness cannot reliably be overcome through willpower alone. Evidence-based treatments like therapy and medication can lead to significant improvement for 70-90% of people. Ignoring symptoms in kids based on the false belief that treatment is useless puts them at greater long-term risk.</p>

                    <h3>Myth: Bad parenting causes mental illness.</h3>
                    <p>Fact: Mental illness arises from many biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Inherited genetics, brain chemistry, prenatal development, childhood adversity, and trauma exposure all shape mental health outcomes. Although a stable home is important, it is not the only factor that contributes to mental illness.</p>
