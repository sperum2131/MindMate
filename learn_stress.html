            <h2>What is Stress?</h2>
            <p>
                Stress is a natural reaction your body and mind have to any demand, challenge, or change. It’s a normal part of life—everyone feels stressed at times, whether from school, work, relationships, or unexpected events. Stress can be positive (helping you stay alert and motivated) or negative (making you feel overwhelmed or anxious).
            </p>
            <p>
                When you encounter something stressful, your body releases hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. This is sometimes called the "fight or flight" response, which prepares you to deal with the situation. While this response can be helpful in the short term, ongoing or chronic stress can take a toll on your health.

            <h2>How Stress Affects You</h2>
            <p>
                Stress can affect you in many ways—physically, emotionally, and even in how you behave. Some common effects include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical:</strong> Headaches, muscle tension, upset stomach, rapid heartbeat, trouble sleeping, or feeling tired all the time.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional:</strong> Feeling anxious, irritable, sad, or overwhelmed. You might notice mood swings or have trouble relaxing.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral:</strong> Changes in appetite, withdrawing from friends or activities, procrastinating, or using substances like caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine more than usual.</li>
                <li><strong>Thinking:</strong> Difficulty concentrating, racing thoughts, or constant worrying.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Managing Stress</h2>
            <p>
                While you can’t always avoid stress, you can learn ways to manage it and take care of yourself. Here are some practical strategies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Practice deep breathing or relaxation techniques:</strong> Try slow, deep breaths, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation to calm your body and mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Move your body:</strong> Physical activity, like walking, stretching, or dancing, can help release tension and boost your mood.</li>
                <li><strong>Talk to someone you trust:</strong> Sharing your feelings with a friend, family member, or counselor can help you feel supported and less alone.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep a regular routine:</strong> Having consistent sleep, meal, and activity times can help your body feel more balanced and in control.</li>
                <li><strong>Take breaks:</strong> Step away from stressful situations when you can, even if just for a few minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Do something you enjoy:</strong> Make time for hobbies, music, art, or anything that helps you relax and recharge.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit stimulants:</strong> Too much caffeine or sugar can make stress feel worse. Try to eat balanced meals and stay hydrated.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask for help:</strong> If stress feels overwhelming or lasts a long time, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for support.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Remember, stress is a normal part of life, but you don’t have to handle it alone. Taking small steps to care for yourself can make a big difference.
