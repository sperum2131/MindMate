            <h2>What is Stress?</h2>
            <p>
                Stress is a natural reaction routed deep in the human body. When you experience challenges or changes (stressors), your body produces physical and mental responses that we know as stress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stress causes your body to adjust to new situations. It can be positive by keeping you alert and ready to avoid danger. For example, if you were stressed about a test you would be motivated to study for it. Stress can also be negative if it continues without periods of relief or relaxation.
            </p>

            <h2>Types of Stress</h2>
            <p>
                There are three main kinds of stress:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acute stress:</strong> Short-term stress that comes and goes quickly, either positive or negative. For instance, this is the stress you experience when you go on a roller-coaster.</li>
                <li><strong>Episodic acute stress:</strong> Acute stress that persists on a regular basis. You never return to a relaxed state or experience any relief. Typically, this occurs in certain professionals like healthcare providers.</li>
                <li><strong>Chronic stress:</strong> Long-term stress that goes on for weeks or months and never stops. This may be due to marriage troubles, issues at work or financial problems. This is widely regarded as the most harmful type of stress.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How Stress Affects Your Body</h2>
            <p>
                Your body's autonomic nervous system controls your heart rate, breathing, vision changes, and more. Its built-in response, the "flight or fight" response, helps deal with stressful situations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sustained chronic stress can keep this system running, leaving profound impacts on your body. These can be physical, psychological, or behavioral.
