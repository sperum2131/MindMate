            <h2>Why is Sleep Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Sleep is a basic human need, just like food and water. It gives your body and mind a chance to rest, recover, and recharge. Good sleep helps you think clearly, manage your emotions, and cope with stress. It also supports your immune system, memory, and overall health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most teens and adults need about 7-9 hours of sleep each night, but the exact amount can vary from person to person. Not getting enough sleep can make you feel tired, irritable, or unfocused, and over time, it can affect your mood, mental health, and physical well-being.

            <h2>Common Sleep Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                Many people struggle with sleep at times. Some common challenges include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trouble falling asleep:</strong> Lying awake for a long time before drifting off.</li>
                <li><strong>Waking up during the night:</strong> Having trouble staying asleep or waking up too early.</li>
                <li><strong>Restless or poor-quality sleep:</strong> Not feeling refreshed even after a full night in bed.</li>
                <li><strong>Daytime sleepiness:</strong> Feeling tired, groggy, or having trouble concentrating during the day.</li>
                <li><strong>Stress or anxiety:</strong> Worrying or racing thoughts that make it hard to relax at bedtime.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Tips for Better Sleep</h2>
            <p>
                The good news is there are simple steps you can take to improve your sleep. Try these evidence-based tips:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep a regular sleep schedule:</strong> Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day—even on weekends if you can.</li>
                <li><strong>Create a relaxing bedtime routine:</strong> Do something calming before bed, like reading, listening to gentle music, or taking a warm shower.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit screens before bed:</strong> Try to avoid phones, tablets, or computers for at least 30–60 minutes before sleep. The light from screens can make it harder to fall asleep.</li>
                <li><strong>Make your bedroom comfortable:</strong> Keep your room cool, dark, and quiet. Use earplugs, an eye mask, or a white noise machine if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Be mindful of food and drinks:</strong> Avoid caffeine (like coffee, tea, or energy drinks) in the afternoon or evening. Try not to eat large meals right before bed.</li>
                <li><strong>Get some daylight and movement:</strong> Spending time outside and being physically active during the day can help you sleep better at night.</li>
                <li><strong>Manage stress:</strong> If worries keep you up, try writing them down or practicing deep breathing or relaxation exercises before bed.</li>
                <li><strong>Use your bed for sleep:</strong> Try not to study, watch TV, or use your phone in bed. This helps your brain connect your bed with sleep.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask for help:</strong> If sleep problems last more than a few weeks or affect your daily life, consider talking to a doctor or mental health professional.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Remember, everyone has a bad night now and then. Small changes to your routine can make a big difference over time. Prioritizing sleep is one of the best things you can do for your mind and body.
