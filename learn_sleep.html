            <h2>What Happens When You Sleep?</h2>
            <p>
                Sleep accounts for one-quarter to one-third of the human lifespan. Before the 1950s, many believed sleep was a passive activity in which the brain was mostly dormant. However, it has been proven that during sleep, the brain undergoes many processes essential to the quality of our lives. As a result, sleep is necessary for the human body to properly function.
            </p>

            <h2>All Sleep Is Not the Same</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout your time asleep, your brain will cycle repeatedly through two different types of sleep: REM (rapid-eye movement) sleep and non-REM sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first part of the cycle is <strong>non-REM sleep</strong>, which has four stages:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> The transition between being awake and falling asleep</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Light sleep, when heart rate and breathing regulate and body temperature drops</li>
                <li><strong>Stage 3 & 4:</strong> Fully asleep and in a deep sleep</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Although REM sleep was previously believed to be the most important sleep phase for learning and memory, newer data suggests that non-REM sleep is more important for these tasks and is the more restful and restorative phase of sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you cycle into <strong>REM sleep</strong>, the eyes move rapidly behind closed lids, and brain waves are similar to those during wakefulness. Breath rate increases and the body becomes paralyzed as we begin to dream.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cycle then repeats itself, but with each cycle you spend less time in the deeper stages three and four of sleep and more time in REM sleep. On a typical night, you'll cycle through four or five times.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Body's Built-In Sleep Controls</h2>
            <p>
                There are two main processes that regulate sleep: <strong>circadian rhythms</strong> and <strong>sleep drive</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Circadian rhythms</strong> are controlled by a biological clock located in the brain. This clock revolves around light. It increases production of melatonin at night, when no light is detected, then returns to normal melatonin levels when it senses light. Hence, blind people often have trouble sleeping.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Sleep drive</strong> also plays a key role. Your body craves sleep, similar to how it craves food. As the day goes on, your sleep drive builds up until you eventually need to sleep. One major distinction is that your body can put you to sleep, but it cannot force you to eat food. No matter where you are, you may fall asleep accidentally. Ultimately, you will always end up following your sleep drive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Napping for more than 30 minutes later in the day can throw off your night's sleep by decreasing your body's sleep drive and mess up your sleep schedule.
            </p>

            <h2>Why You Need Sleep</h2>
            <p>
                Poor sleep is a major issue as it significantly impacts brain function. A healthy amount of sleep is necessary for "brain plasticity", the brain's ability to adapt to input. A lack of sleep can make it harder to process what we learn during the day and actually retain that knowledge for the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Researchers also believe that sleep can promote the removal of waste products from brain cells, as the process is more inefficient when the brain is awake.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sleep is vital to the rest of the body too. When people do not get enough sleep, they have more health risks. Depression, seizures, high blood pressure, and migraine may worsen. Immune systems are weakened, increasing the likelihood of illness. Sleep also directs our metabolic systems, so it is important to stay on a consistent schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many important connections between health and sleep. Getting quality sleep is necessary for maintaining both mental and physical well-being.
            </p>

            <h2>Tips for Better Sleep</h2>
            <p>
                These habits can help you get better sleep:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fix your circadian rhythm:</strong> Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day</li>
                <li><strong>Manage light exposure:</strong> Get plenty of natural light during the day and avoid bright screens before bedtime</li>
                <li><strong>Create a healthy environment:</strong> Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet</li>
                <li><strong>Limit daytime naps:</strong> If you nap, keep it under 30 minutes and avoid napping late in the day</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise regularly:</strong> Physical activity can help regulate your sleep drive and improve sleep quality</li>
                <li><strong>Watch your diet:</strong> Avoid large meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime</li>
                <li><strong>Establish a bedtime routine:</strong> Create relaxing activities that signal to your brain it's time to sleep</li>
                <li><strong>Seek professional help:</strong> If sleep problems persist, consider consulting a sleep specialist</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Sleep is important for the body and mind. It is a necessary part of life. As a teenager, I have neglected my sleep, but writing this article has made me realize how important it is. Thank you for reading.
