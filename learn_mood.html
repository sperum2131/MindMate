            <h2>What is Mood?</h2>
            <p>
                Your mood is a reflection of your emotion. The American Psychological Association (APA) defines mood as “a disposition to respond emotionally in a particular way that may last for hours, days, or even weeks, perhaps at a low level and without the person knowing what prompted the state.” The key distinction here being that emotions are generally temporary, whereas our moods are much more persistent.</p>
            <p>
                Our moods have power. Studies show that your mood can influence perception, motivation, decision-making, social interactions, and even more basic cognitive processes like memory or attention. When these moods continue for days on end, they influence all aspects of our lives.
            </p>

            <h2>How the Brain Controls Mood</h2>
            <p>
                The brain is responsible for thoughts, feelings, and actions. Multiple regions of the brain make up our emotion system:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amygdala:</strong> Helps with memory, decision-making, and emotional responses</li>
                <li><strong>Insula:</strong> Involved in emotional regulation and self-awareness</li>
                <li><strong>Periaqueductal gray:</strong> Helps regulate emotional responses</li>
                <li><strong>Hippocampus:</strong> Important for mood regulation and memory</li>
                <li><strong>Thalamus:</strong> Used to regulate sleep, consciousness, and attention</li>
                <li><strong>Hypothalamus:</strong> Controls body temperature, hunger, fatigue, and sleep</li>
                <li><strong>Basal ganglia:</strong> Directs movements, learning, habit cognition, and emotion</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These areas are part of the brain’s limbic or emotion system, and are responsible for summoning our feelings. This system helps us to seek out the things we both want and need, protect ourselves from harm, and socially connect with others. The brain relies on multiple neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine to communicate vital messages between neurons and regulate mood.
            </p>

            <h2>Mood Disorders</h2>
            <p>
                If a mood, usually a negative mood, gets in the way of your work and family life, it can become a problem known as a <strong>mood disorder</strong>. Some common mood disorders include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Depression:</strong> A persistent dampening in mood, or persistent feelings of hopelessness/sadness. Usually, depression lasts for weeks or months on end, and affect many other areas of our lives. For example, it can take away from who we spend our time with, what we end up doing, etc. Extreme cases may have feelings of suicidality.  </li>
                <li><strong>Bipolar Disorder:</strong> Characterized by dramatic shifts between depression and extremely elevated mood states (manic episodes). During these manic episodes, people may experience intense energy, racing thoughts, distractibility, and increased risk-taking behaviors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Doctors recommend that if you experience a depressed or extremely heightened mood for more than two weeks that interferes with your ability to live your life, it's important to seek help from a medical provider.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Are Teens So Moody?</h2>
            <p>
                Teenagers are more moody than other age groups because of puberty. The same hormones that causes teens to grow also causes extreme development in the brain. The brain has specific receptors for hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone, and heightened levels of these chemicals lead teens to have heightened emotional reactions to specific situations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, these emotions usually pass as teens gain more experience to help them regulate their moods and emotional states. This only comes after a lot of struggle however. If you or another teen you know has continuously had these symptoms, it may be time to reach out a medical professional.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Improve Your Mood</h2>
            <p>
                Due to neuroplasticity, the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth/reorganization, there are specific actions you can take to improve your mood:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regular cardiovascular exercise:</strong> Physical activity helps lower stress and regulate hormone and neurotransmitter levels</li>
                <li><strong>Ample sleep (7-8 hours each night):</strong> Quality sleep is essential for mood regulation and emotional well-being</li>
                <li><strong>Nutritious foods:</strong> Include nutrients like Omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, and B vitamins in your diet</li>
                <li><strong>Meditation and mindfulness:</strong> These practices can help regulate stress and improve emotional regulation</li>
                <li><strong>Time outdoors and sunshine:</strong> Natural light and outdoor time have been shown to improve mood</li>
                <li><strong>Social connections:</strong> Spending time with others can significantly boost your mood</li>
                <li><strong>Professional help:</strong> For those struggling with mood disorders, medications and therapy methods like cognitive-behavioral therapy can teach helpful self-talk and improve mood over the long term</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Improving your mood is a process that may take weeks, or even months. When consistently maintaining these small habits, however, it comes naturally. I've experienced mood swings, and I have learned how to manage them effecctively by following these tips. Thank you for reading.
